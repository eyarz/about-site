[The Headway Project](https://github.com/headwaymaps) was born out of a frustration with the need to send current and future location data to a corporation in order to figure out how we're getting from A to B. Offline-only maps apps can be frustrating to use, and sometimes suffer from performance problems, poor data coverage, or other technical limitations.

[Headway](https://github.com/headwaymaps/headway) aims to remedy these issues by bundling industry-standard software into a web app that's easy to set up for yourself or your friends. No need to send your location data to anyone you don't trust, not even [maps.earth](https://maps.earth/).
